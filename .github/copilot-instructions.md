This project is a Vite + React TypeScript app for calculating OSRS Delve run expected value and gp/hour. Prioritize clean, simple UI and efficient state management. Fetch item prices from the RuneScape Wiki API. Allow users to add, edit, and reset runs, each with Delve level and time taken. Show expected value and gp/hour based on drop rates and prices.
